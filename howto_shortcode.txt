SHORTCODE HOWTO

The shortcode for inserting a ZenphotoPress badge into Wordpress posts is
[zenphotopress].

It is possible to add some parameters:
- sort
   Is the sorting method for the displayed thumbnails. Currently accepts
   "random", "latest", "sort_order", "title", "id" as possible values.
   Default is "random".
- number
   The number of thumbnails to show in the badge.
   Default is 3.
- album
   The ID of the album to pick the thumbnails from.
   Default is to pick from all the albums.
   
All the parameters are optional. Given the default values, a shortcode like
[zenphotopress]
has the same effect as
[zenphotopress sort=random number=3 album=0]
   
(Notice that album=0 means "pick from all albums")
